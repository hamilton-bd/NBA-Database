## NBA Database

This repository contains the tools necessary to create and populate a database, NBA_DATA, in MySQL.

In addition, it contains a Python program that uses Flask to display queries on the data as well as HTML templates to style the data returned by the queries.

Note: The data in *basketball.csv* is not accurate NBA data; I created the data for use in this project for fun.
